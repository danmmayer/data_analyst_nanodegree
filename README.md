# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
This repository contains my project outputs from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (enrolled 10/2020-02/2021)

## Project 0: Explore Weather Trends
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends. Submit as a PDF report.
- Tools used: SQL, Google Sheets
- [Report](https://github.com/danmmayer/udacity_dand/blob/main/project0_weather_trends/summary_report.pdf)

## Project 1: Investigate a Dataset
Analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. Note: I conducted my analysis on the [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) from Kaggle
- Tools used: Anaconda (Python installation), SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Python (NumPy, pandas, MatPlotlib, Seaborn)
- [Analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/danmmayer/udacity_dand/blob/main/project1_investigate_a_dataset/kaggle_soccer_database_insights.html)

## Project 2: Analyze A/B Test Results
Apply probability and statistical techniques to understand and interpret the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
- Tools used: Jupyter Notebook, Python (NumPy, pandas, statsmodels)
- [Analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/danmmayer/udacity_dand/blob/main/project2_analyze_ab_test/ab_test_results_analysis.html)

## Project 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess them for quality and tidiness, then clean them. Showcase your wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.
- Tools used: Twitter API, Jupyter Notebook, Python (NumPy, pandas, requests, json, tweepy, PIL, matplotlib, seaborn)
- [Analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/danmmayer/udacity_dand/blob/main/project3_wrangle_analyze_data/wrangle_act.html)
- [Technical Report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/danmmayer/udacity_dand/blob/main/project3_wrangle_analyze_data/wrangle_report.html)
- [Summary Report](https://github.com/danmmayer/udacity_dand/blob/main/project3_wrangle_analyze_data/act_report.pdf)


## Project 4: Communicate Data Findings
Choose a dataset, either your own or a Udacity-curated dataset, and perform an exploratory data analysis using Python. Then create a presentation with explanatory plots that communicates you findings.
